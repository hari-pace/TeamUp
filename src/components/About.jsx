                Moving from the UK to Munich at the end of 2018, I've enjoyed
                almost 5 years living in Germany and can't see myself leaving
                any time soon! A keen football player for over 20 years, I have
                experienced first-hand how easily new friendships can be formed
                through sport, hence the creation of this app. I've loved being
                a part of the TeamUp team, and upon completion of our Full-Stack
                Web Development course, I look forward to kick-starting my new
                career in tech

                As a basketball lover I think that it must be very easy to bond
                with new people via sport. Since the time I became a foreigner
                in Germany I do not find it easy no more: lack of courts and
                language barrier makes it very difficult to find your crew. I
                truly believe that no matter where you are or who you are, you
                should be able to play your favorite sport. I am very pleased
                with opportunity to build this app with my new team of Hari,
                Ehsan and Darrell (yes, JavaScript is also a team sport!)

                I came to Germany as a student in 2016. As a newcomer, I was
                eager to immerse myself in the local culture, and what better
                way to do that than through sports? I was particularly
                interested in team sports, as they not only provide a great way
                to stay fit, but also offer an opportunity to socialize and make
                new friends. However, I found it challenging to find a local
                sports group that I could join. Thatâ€™s when the idea of
                developing an application that could help people connect over
                their shared love for sports and facilitate joining sports
                groups

                From the UK and moved to Germany in October 2020. Not
                particularly sporty nor competitive but love exercising
                outdoors. A son to a personal trainer, I know that the main
                barrier to exercise is in the mind, not in the body. Playing for
                fun and laughs is a big thing for me and I think this sentiment
                is lost, particularly in serious sport groups. Sport should be
                open to everyone and a way to unwind, decompress and have a
                laugh with other people. That way, it is a significant mood
                booster and something we can all benefit from
